      <p>Today I started working on the UI of the app. I'm not familiar with programming in Kotlin, but because I'm using an IDE it won't be too difficult to learn.</p>

      <p>Today I set up a GitHub for the board game project and started organizing the plan using GitHub's project system. I found out that Unreal does not support NFC, so I'm going to have either find a way to add NFC support to Unreal, or find another way to make the app. If I can't get Unreal to work, I'm just going to have to learn Java and start from scratch using android studio. This is a last resort, because I'm not familiar with Java at all, but it might be the only option.</p>

      <p style="font-family:Ariel, sans-serif">Over the course of the past 2 days I got started with laying out the plans for the app i'm going to be developing. I don't have any screenshots to share for this entry because none of the work done was done digitally. The plan is to create game pieces that have RFID tags embedded in them. 99% of modern Android phones have NFC, which can be used to read from and write to the 1KB memory contained within the RFID tags. The app will simply write a number into the tokens at the start of the game, and then load content from a pool based on what tokens are read from during gameplay. this will enable players to simply touch their phone onto the token to access dialog options.</p>

    <div class="entry flex-container"><h4 style="margins:0;">Feb 6, 2020</h4><hr><p style="font-family:Ariel, sans-serif;">Today I learned how to restart a level, reset characters, and spawn new objects in during gameplay.</p>

  <div class="entry flex-container"><h4 style="margins:0;">Feb 5, 2020</h4><hr><p style="font-family:Ariel,sans-serif;">Today I figured out how to set up a user interface in Unreal. I was able to implement a HUD with health and score counters. at this point I have a semi-playable game.</p>

  <div class="entry flex-container"><h4 style="margins:0;">Feb 4, 2020</h4><hr><p style="font-family:Ariel,sans-serif;">Today I finished watching the VirtusHub videos. unfortunately, they only taught me the very basics of Blueprints. I'm still going to have too learn quite a bit before I can use Blueprints well. I finished setting up the simple procedural animation blueprint from yesterday, which maps a sine wave to a snake's skeleton to make it look like it's slithering. After that I got started on figuring out how to set up NPCs and make AI for them. while I haven't looked at the documentation yet, that's going to be the next step for sure.

<div class="entry flex-container"><h4 style="margins:0;">Feb 3, 2020</h4><hr><p style="font-family:Ariel,sans-serif;">Yesterday I managed to get Unreal Engine to run on my personal laptop, so I was able to get started today. The VirtusHub tutorials are really meant for someone with zero pre-existing knowledge of programming, so I have decided to just skip the videos covering things I am aready familiar with: videos 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, and 12. I made it video #22 today, though I was really just doing things on my own for most of that time so I can get used to the visual programming system. What I got down today is how to use the animation blueprint system, how the datatypes work, and how to control the flow of a program.
