<a class="linkbox" href="https://github.com/willlovesbearz/Advanced-wiimote-tracking"><h3>Advanced wiimote tracking</h3><hr><p>Advanced wiimote tracking is a WIP python application that intends to enable 6DOF tracking of a wii controller. while this may not happen, it will at the very least enable usage of wii controllers with linux systems, since all good software for that purpose has been exclusive to windows. It is currently incomplete and will will likely remain that way for quite a while because I have not had much time to work on it, although I do still plan on finishing it at some point.
The purpose of this project is to enable me to teach myself how to use version control software, and provide an opportunity for me to improve my skills in programming with python. This project is also my first attempt at developing software in the public domain.</p></a>

<h3>Riser for Elecom EX-G Pro mouse</h3>
<hr>
<p> I purchased a new trackball mouse, but found that the angle it sits at is way too low for me. I decided to solve this problem by designing a riser in Blender and then 3D printing it.</p>
